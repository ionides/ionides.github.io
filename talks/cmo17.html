<h3> A 5-minute summary of three courses</h3>


<ol>
  <li> <a href="http://ionides.github.io/531w16/">
      A one-semester time series course for Masters level statisticians:
      </a>
    <ul>
      <li> First half of the course: a likelihood-based approach to linear time series models.
      <li> Second half: likelihood-based investigation of nonlinear state space models, using plug-and-play methodology in the R package pomp.
    </ul>
    <br>
  <li> A three-day (15 classroom hours) course for graduate students interested in <a href="https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/">state space modeling in epidemiology</a>.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
  <li> A six-lecture (8 classroom hours) course on <a href="http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~ionides/talks/upenn/">nonlinear non-Gaussian state space models for PhD students</a>.
    </ol>
