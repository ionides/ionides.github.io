 <title>Inference for Mechanistic Models in the Polio Endgame, by Edward Ionides</title>

<h2>Inference for Mechanistic Models in the Polio Endgame</h2>
<h3>Edward Ionides, University of Michigan, Dept of Statistics</h3>

I'm going to present a case study of recent statistical methodology developments in the context of <a href="http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~ionides/tutorials/polio/polio.html">pre-vaccine era polio in Wisconsin</a>.

<h3>Relevance to this workshop</h3>

<ol>
<li>Some questions: What aspects of polio transmission dynamics require investigation to support the eradication program? What data are needed? What models are appropriate? How do we obtain statistical inferences from the data in the context of the models?</li>
<br>
<li>Recent advances in algorithms, software and computer power facilitate analyses of time series data. Previously hard or intractable inference problems become routine.</li>
<br>
<li>This case study comes with open-source code that can readily be modified for other data or model variations.</li>
<br>
<li>More questions: What information can be extracted from existing data? Which questions should be pursued using time series data, and which using genetic data? Can we plan data analyses that would be useful, and sketch out how to carry them out?</li>
